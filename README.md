A simple web application for container orchestrator testing

This is a simple web application that can be used to test container 
orchestrators like Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker Swarm, etc. It is a simple web
application that displays the hostname of the pod/container that is serving the
request.

## Usage

The image serves a simple web application on port 8000 by default, which returns
the hostname of the pod/container in a `h1` tag. Besides the root path, the
application also serves a `/api` path that returns the hostname in a `p` tag.

You can also set the `API_URL` environment variable to append content from the
API to the html output, this can be used to simulate full stack applications
with load balancers, databases, etc.

A sample `docker-compose` file is as follows:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: jljl1337/testpod
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://backend:8000/api

  backend:
    image: jljl1337/testpod
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://database:8000/api

  database:
    image: jljl1337/testpod
```

More examples can be found in the `examples` directory [here](https://github.com/jljl1337/testpod/tree/main/examples).

The environment variables can be set are:

- `API_URL`: The URL to fetch content from and append to the html output
- `HOST`: The host to serve the application on
- `PORT`: The port to serve the application on

## Development

Files for dev container are included, but you can also run the application
locally.

If you are developing locally, first install
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Run the following command to create the virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
uv run main
```
